Enables MAVLink communication between an AutoQuad drone and a computer
running ROS.

2017-04-30
This is the first commit of code written a couple of years ago. It worked
well but has not been profiled for release, therefore a few comments:

- The aqmavros/uas_nordic_2015/launch/drone_demo_final.launch is
  known to work succesfully.

- There is some dependencies on http://github.com/FroboLab/FroboMind so
  please follow the installation guide at http://frobomind.org
